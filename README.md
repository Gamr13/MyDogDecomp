# MyDog J2ME Decompilation Project

MyDog is a game I have fond memories of as a kid on my Motorola V535. 

After spending years learning Java, I want to attempt to decompile this game and make the code readable with comments. 

My end-goal is to have a fully buildable version of the game that works on Nokia phones, and hopefully add some fixes to make the game work on a variety of devices.
