Game Modes
My Dog features four main game-play modes. These modes allow you to interact with your pet in a number of ways. \n\nOBJECT MODE...\n allows you to select objects, such as food and toys from the house, to give to your pet.\n\nPETTING MODE...\n lets you pet your dog and pick it up. You can even move rooms while carrying your dog! \n\nWALK MODE...\n gives you the opportunity to take your dog for a walk. Visit the Pet Shop or Pet Show for even more fun!\n\nWATCH MODE...\n allows you to follow your pet around automatically. It's a great way to make sure they are behaving themselves!
Pet Behavior
Watch your dog's behavior carefully to understand its mood and health. Doggy thought bubbles will also appear from time to time.\n\nThought bubbles will communicate not only the specific needs of your pet but also its mood and health.

Hi $B. I'm Ralph, your local vet. Can I take a few minutes to show you how to look after $A?
Great! Your house has three rooms, use key 1 for garden, 2 for kitchen and 3 for living room. Let's go inside...
ENTER KITCHEN\nPRESS KEY 2
Pet time and human time are the same. Keep your pet healthy by providing food and drink at least twice daily.
Food and drink is stored in the fridge. The fridge is an object that is selected from the OBJECT mode in the MENU.
SELECT MENU
You can scroll through MENU options using keys 4 and 6. Select using key 5. OBJECT mode is the red box icon.
SELECT OBJECT MODE\n4+6 SCROLL / 5 SELECT
Ok, now you're in OBJECT mode! Use keys 4 and 6 to scroll through objects. Select using key 5. Let's open the fridge...
OPEN THE FRIDGE\n4+6 SCROLL / 5 SELECT
Good work! Now you can select food or drink for $A. Scroll using keys 4, 6, 2 and 8. Select using key 5.
SELECT DOG FOOD\n4,6,2+8 SCROLL / 5 SELECT
You'll notice the food bowl has now been filled. You can also give your dog tap water. It's free!
Feed your pet twice a day to keep $A healthy. Now let's move to the living room so I can tell you about toys.
ENTER LIVING ROOM\nPRESS KEY 3
Dogs love to play! You can buy toys from the Pet Shop but I've given you one free! It's in the toy box...
OPEN TOY BOX\n4+6 SCROLL / 5 SELECT
SELECT SLIPPER\n4,6,2+8 SCROLL / 5 SELECT
Fantastic! You're going to make a great owner. Exercise is very important for your dog...
You can take your dog for a walk by selecting WALK mode. It's the blue paw icon on the MENU.
SELECT WALK MODE\n4+6 SCROLL / 5 SELECT
This is a map of your neighborhood. Use the map to choose where to walk. Let's walk around the block...
WALK AROUND THE BLOCK\n4+6 SCROLL / 5 SELECT
Did you notice the Pet Shop and Pet Show? Don't worry you'll find out more about them later.
Don't be surprised when strange things happen when out walking your pet. Dogs love surprises!
There are two more modes in the MENU. PETTING mode (yellow hand icon) allows you to pet your dog...
The WATCH mode (green eye icon) allows you to watch your pet without any disturbance.
I hope you are still listening to me... Watch $A carefully as $D will let you know what $D is thinking...
Thoughts appear in little bubbles and give a good indication of what your dog needs, or how they are feeling.
Well that's all you need to know. I'll visit you now and again with some useful advice if you need it.
Oh and be warned... If I hear that you aren't taking good care of $A I'll be back to pay you a visit!
It sounds like $A has just been delivered and is waiting in the kitchen for you. Best of luck!
I'm Gladys and this is my little Pet Shop. Is this really your first visit? Don't worry I'll show you around...
You'll receive an allowance of $10 each day. You can use this money to buy items from my Pet Shop...
Did you hear about Pet Shows? I'd strongly recommend entering them. You can win big cash prizes!
My shop has three aisles: Kitchen (Food+Drink), Garden (Outdoor Toys) and Living Room (Indoor Toys). Scroll using keys 4,6,2+8. Select using key 5.
SELECT AN ITEM\n 4,6,2+8 SCROLL / 5 SELECT
You'll be glad to know all prices include fast home delivery. I'm sure I have the best store in town! 
Not only do I sell goods I'll also buy old ones from you. I'll pay half their original value if they are in mint condition.
As you know $B my shop is very popular so don't be surprised if sometimes I'm low on stock...
Shop early in the day for the best choice. Oh and please leave your pet outside. I don't like animals!
Hello! I don't think we've met before. I'm Norris and I'm the head judge at the Pet Show...
Listen carefully and I'll be pleased to tell you how Pet Shows are run...
A new event takes place each day but you can only enter events for your class of dog...
Dogs begin at puppy class but as they get older they'll be able to enter advanced shows...
Advanced shows cost more to enter but the prizes are bigger! I'm sure you'll be entering just for fun though...
Ok just in case you are interested... Prize money is awarded for the top three dogs in each class...
$A will compete against four rivals. Each dog's score is shown as they are judged in turn.
Ensure $A is fit and well before entering events otherwise you won't stand a chance of winning.
I think that's all the help I can be right now. I look forward to seeing you and $A at the show!
Have you noticed those stars on the pet certificate? Each day your pet is in good health you'll earn a star...
Get seven stars in a row and you'll receive a weekly star. Stars give you points. Everyone likes points!
Nice to see you! Have you given $A a wash yet? A clean pet is a happy pet! Use the hose in the garden.
A word in your ear... Your pet will get upset if you keep giving it the same food or toy. Variety is the key!
Can't get your pet to go where you want it? Pick it up in PETTING mode and drop it in a new room.
I heard you bought a dog whistle! Use it by pressing key 0 to try to get your pet to come to you from anywhere in the house.
Hello again! I've got a great tip for you... HOLD DOWN key 5 when petting your dog, it will increase their enjoyment!
$A has had a great day! You have been rewarded with a small star! 
You've kept $A in great shape all week. A large star is all yours!
Your pet is clearly being neglected. If there is no improvement within three days I'll inform Pet Rescue.
I've given $A medication that will help it regain full health. Please ensure you take better care of your pet.
Medicine is no replacement for the daily care of your dog. If I have to return I'll be taking your pet back to Pet Rescue.
Yet again you're not looking after your dog! You have three days to improve its health or else we will take it off you!
I have no choice but to take $A away. You should be ashamed of yourself! I have never seen an animal treated so poorly.
